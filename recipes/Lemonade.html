    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar and Water</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Juice Your Lemons</strong></div>
            Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer. Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Make a Simple Syrup </strong></div>
            It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Stir</strong></div>
            Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.  
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Serve</strong></div>
            Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel. 
        </li>
